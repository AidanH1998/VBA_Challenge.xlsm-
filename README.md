**Whaat We Have To DO?**

In this challenge we are looking at the 12 stocks that we want to invest in and in order to invest in them we have to know how they are doing in the selected years, 2017 and 2018.

What we have to do is find the return of the stock in percentage form so that we can determine if the stock in that year was green or not.

**Why Use RSA?**

So why would we Refactor Stock Analysis, that would be because the time is fast inwhich the information is being given to you, less than a sec to get the information that you need. The con of Refactor Stock Analysis is that the code would take up the time to setup and adding in the correct data point for the stock.

**Disadavantage of RSA?**

The coding takes time, means that maintaining the code for different stocks would be necessary because you would be using this to look at different points of the Stocks

**Advantages of RSA?**

Your using RSA for the speed at which the information is given after the code is already done, as shown in the screenshots for 2017 and 2018 the time was less than a sec.
